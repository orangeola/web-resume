          Hi, I'm Alexander. After completing my computer science degree, I decided that it was the perfect time to continue studying and explore other potential careers within software development. I promptly studied game development for a year, and then full-stack web development.

          After all these years of study, I feel ready and committed to contribute to meaningful projects with others. As an avid life-long learner, I am excited to begin the next stage of my life and develop myself both professionally and personally while I help build projects greater than myself.
        </p>

          Outside coding, I enjoy reading (with the occasional bit of writing) along with trips to the cinema. I also enjoy playing badminton and tennis, as well as going on hikes out in nature. I have also recently picked up a guitar, and am excited to learn!
